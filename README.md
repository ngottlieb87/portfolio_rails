# _Noah Gottlieb's Portfolio_
### Created By _Noah Gottlieb_

## Description

This project demonstrates my strengths as a developing junior programmer. Over the past four months i went from having the very basic knowledge of a handful or languages and frameworks to feeling comfortable building web applications that incorporate user authentication and admin routing for example.

## My Strengths

  * `If I have an idea for my application and am not sure how i am going to implement it I can research and find the correct fit to full fill my need. I gained this talent from my years researching and writing History papers when i was in college completing my BA in History. I love research and correct researching habits is a must for any programmer. I might not know right away how to implement a new feature but i will find out!`
