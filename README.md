# _Noah Gottlieb's Portfolio_
### Created By _Noah Gottlieb_

## Description

This project demonstrates my strengths as a developing junior programmer. Over the past four months i went from having the very basic knowledge of a handful or languages and frameworks to feeling comfortable building web applications that incorporate user authentication and admin routing for example.

## My Strengths
##### As a programmer
  * If I have an idea for my application and am not sure how i am going to implement it I can research and find the correct fit to full fill my need. I gained this talent from my years researching and writing History papers when i was in college completing my BA in History. I love research and correct researching habits is a must for any programmer. I might not know right away how to implement a new feature but i will find out!

  * While i love building web applications I also enjoy making a website that looks appetizing. A website can have really impressive applications but if it isn't easily accessible and have style users will move on to a different application that does. I have taken on learning SASS to creating a stylized site that integrates applications and looks `cool`.
##### As a person
  * One of my passions is `cooking!` I love to push myself and find new recipes to conquer and more often than not they end up being delicious. I following steps that allow me improvise on them and create something unique that i can share with friends. Not too different from programming! One of the sites that i love to go to to get inspiration is [`Cooks Illustrated`](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/). You have to have an account to access their recipes but they still have great information that is accessible.
